# NineBillion
A FORTRAN 77 program to generate the nine billion names of God, based on the 1953 Arthur C. Clarke short story of the same name.

To compile on GNU/linux, use: gfortran -o ninebn -std=legacy ninebn.f

Note that because the description of the algorithm required to generate the names in the story is incomplete, this version generates
approximately 11.5 billion possible names from a 13 character alphabet.

No responsibility is taken by the author if you run this program and overhead, without any fuss, the stars go out.
